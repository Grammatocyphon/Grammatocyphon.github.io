        <h2>Phrygian</h2>
          <article>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Long before Alexander of Macedon set out to conquer Asia, there lived a people in the western heartland of Anatolia: the Phrygians.
              They filled a local power vacuum after the collapse of the Hittite Empire at the close of the Bronze Age, and proved to be quite influential.
              After a few centuries of regional dominance, however, their civilisation was superseded, first by the Lydians under Croesus as Herodotus recounts, then by the Persians under Cyrus the Great.
              Through the conquests of Alexander the Great, their territory fell into the hands of Hellenistic kings, after which the Romans asserted themselves as hegemon across the Mediterranean, including the Province of Asia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Few remnants remain of the Phrygians.
              Several archaeological sites have been unearthed, the greatest of them ancient Gordion, where high investment in the production and trade of textiles attests to a lucrative and strong economy at one point in time.
              Throughout Asia Minor, attestations to the Phrygian language have been found as well.
              These texts are scant and epigraphic in nature, and provide a very limited corpus for our understanding of their tongue.
              Though only short fragments remain, not much over 500 in number, Phrygian is the most promising fragmentary language of the Indo-European phylum.

            <h3>Recommended literature</h3>
            <p>
              There are many excellent publications within the field.
              These range from general overviews to in-depth research papers.
              Below is a non-exhaustive list of reference material which I incessantly hold onto.

              A sizeable part of the available literature comprises less attractive material.
              These are either outdated or never made sense in the first place, but are definitely valuable in order to assess how far phrygology has come since the 1820s.
              The list below is again non-exhaustive and does not intend to scare readers away.
              Quite the opposite, in fact; their reading is, in my opinion, a treasure trove on its own.

            <h3>My contributions</h3>
            <p>
              For my Master's thesis in linguistics, I annotated the New Phrygian for corpus-linguistic inquiry. The resulting treebank is part of the Universal Dependencies (UD) project.

              In my current pursuit of a Master's degree in Ancient History, I am writing my thesis on the geographical history of Phrygia.
