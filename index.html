        <h2>About me</h2>
        <article>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my personal web page.<br />Feel free to look around, discover my interests, and get to know me a little better.</p>
        <p>
          I am a classicist, linguist, and student of ancient history at KU Leuven.
          My main interests are <a href="/phrygian.html" title="Read more.">the Phrygian people and their language</a>, as well as ancient fragmentary languages and sound systems.
          My curiosity is rarely satiated, however.
          I have attended several Summer School courses of Languages and Linguistics by Leiden University,
          and have been getting into <a title="Hopefully soon some programming languages as well.">mark-up languages</a>, creating relational databases, and my own computer literacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I like to write poetry in Latin and Dutch.
          I (should) know how to play the organ, but really only practice on piano.
          I am also learning to sew.
        </p>
        <p>
          My native language is Dutch, and I am very comfortable with English.
          I speak French and German <a title="Lit. 'with hairs', i.e. with occasional mistakes"><em>met haar op</em></a>, but have little difficulty reading.
          With effort, I can understand Spanish and Italian texts, in particular academic literature. Yet I do not formally know these.
          Latin and Ancient Greek I know as an object of scholarly study, but I am also somewhat proficient in them.
          I can read texts with ease, barring the occasional translation error, and with proper thought can compose texts.
